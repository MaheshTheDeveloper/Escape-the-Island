# Escape-the-Island

In this game, the player is stranded on a deserted island and must find a way to escape. The island is filled with various resources, such as trees, rocks, and animals, which the player can use to their advantage.

The player must gather resources and use them to build shelter, find food, and craft tools and weapons. They will also need to fend off dangerous creatures and navigate the island's terrain to find a way off.

As the player progresses, they will encounter more challenging obstacles and puzzles, and they will need to use their wit and resourcefulness to overcome them. The ultimate goal is to find a way to signal for rescue and escape the island.

This game could have a survival or adventure genre, and it could feature beautiful, hand-drawn graphics and an immersive, open-world environment.
